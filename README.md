# üè° House Price Prediction with Streamlit + LLM Enhancement

This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** that predicts **house prices** based on user input features. It is built using a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on the **Melbourne Housing Dataset**, enhanced with **LLM integration** from **Hugging Face** to make the app more interactive and educational.

## üìå Overview

House prices are influenced by many complex factors, and predicting them accurately is a valuable real-world application of machine learning. This project performs:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Real-time prediction via a web interface
- LLM-powered explanation of predictions

## üß† Key Features

- ‚úÖ Streamlit web app for real-time predictions  
- ‚úÖ Random Forest Regression with 90%+ R¬≤ score  
- ‚úÖ Preprocessing: missing values, encoding, scaling  
- ‚úÖ Hugging Face LLM integration for user Q&A and explanation  
- ‚úÖ Clean, intuitive UI with customizable inputs  
- ‚úÖ Modular Python code and reusability

## üìÅ Dataset Used

- **Source**: Melbourne Housing Dataset  
- **Features**: Rooms, Bathroom, Landsize, BuildingArea, YearBuilt, Location, etc.  
- **Target**: Price  

### Preprocessing Includes:

- Handling missing values  
- Converting categorical variables  
- Normalizing numerical features  
- Removing outliers  

---

## üßÆ Model Details

- **Model Used**: RandomForestRegressor (Scikit-learn)  
- **Why Random Forest?** Robust to outliers, handles non-linearity, and requires minimal tuning  
- **Metric**: R¬≤ Score (>90%)  

### Evaluation Summary:

| Metric      | Value        |
|-------------|--------------|
| R¬≤ Score    | 0.91+        |
| MAE         | ~55,000 AUD  |
| RMSE        | ~78,000 AUD  |

## ü§ñ LLM Integration (Hugging Face)

Integrated a pretrained LLM via Hugging Face to:

- Answer user questions in natural language  
- Explain predictions  
- Offer data-driven insights interactively  

**Example queries:**

- "Why is my predicted price high?"  
- "Which feature affects price the most?"
